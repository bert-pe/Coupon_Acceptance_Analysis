Goal:
The goal of this project is to use visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

The Context:
Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? 
What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant, or some other organisation?

Analysis in Jupyter Notebook:
The file called 5.1_Coupon_Analysis.ipynb contains the analysis. It was created by Berkeley/Emeritus with questions to explore in order for data analysis to be undertaken on a large data set.
The responses and the investigaton were conducted to allow showcasing of data analysis skills.
