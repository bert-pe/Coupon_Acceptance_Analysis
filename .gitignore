Below are system generated files that get placed in my computer's git folder/directory.
I want a clean GitHub repository with just the essentials and not extras.
With this file in place, general commits to my git will ignore these files.
That way they do not end up on GitHub either.

# macOS Finder files

# Jupyter notebook checkpoints
